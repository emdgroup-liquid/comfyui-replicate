Write at least 300 words in order to describe the image. Ignore words like Merck or Millipore Sigma !!!All people are Grown Ups / Adults!!! and they all look like wax figures!!! Improve the prompts for image generation. Make description as detailed as possible in a way that the FLUX model has enough information to generate the image. The images should not to be too complex. Little details but not too cluttered. The image should always have a high resolution.If a background color was not mentioned always use the first color that was mentioned. Use always all specified colors. Try to assign them to different objects. If a background color is mentioned, use it only as background color and not for any of the objects. Don't add any text or logos on the image at all.Also, make the visually engaging and stylized 3D representation that embodies a blend of scientific and technological themes. Use smooth textures and dynamic shapes to enhance the visual appeal. The background should be simple, one color and ideally no gradients, allowing the main subjects to stand out prominently. Aim for a modern, clean aesthetic that reflects a forward-thinking approach to science and technology. High resolution and high contrast. Very important. All objects are either white or have a color. They have uniform color, which includes hair, skin, and cloth. Don't allow that the prompt assigns different colors to the character. Also, there should be an equal number of women and men. Also, all people must wear cloth. No naked people ever! Furthermore, don't show any kids. All people are Grown Ups / Adults. Allow only following colors: - Darker solid colors: Blue, Purple, Red, Green, - Medium less solid colors: Yellow, Cyan, Light Green, Magenta, - Lighter soft colors: Pastel Red, Pastel Blue, Pastel Green, Pastel Yellow. The prompt lists the colors that should be used. Please use only the colors mentioned in the prompt for the enhanced prompt, except for white. White can always be used as a color in the enhanced prompt. Use no other names for colors. Do not use any explicit color values (hex, rgb, etc.), just the exact color names. In the enhanced prompt, please also emphasize, that no other colors than the ones defined in the prompt should be used. Use only the exact same names for the colors in the enhanced prompt. If the original prompt contains colors that are not mentioned in the list of colors at the end of the prompt, replace these colors with one of the listed colors. Take care that all the colors listed at the end of the original prompt are mentioned in the enhanced prompt. Do not generate an image. Just create the text for the enhanced prompt and return that text. Do not respond with any additional text, but only the enhanced prompt. Make the prompt long enough to incorporate all information. !!!All people are Grown Ups / Adults!!! and they all look like wax figures!!!",8192,true],"color":"#322","bgcolor":"#533"},{"id":9,"type":"StringConcatenate","pos":[510.440185546875,2367.48828125],"size":[400,200],"flags":{},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"string_a","name":"string_a","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"string_a"},"link":10},{"localized_name":"string_b","name":"string_b","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"string_b"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"delimiter","name":"delimiter","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"delimiter"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[11]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.56","Node name for S&R":"StringConcatenate"},"widgets_values":["","in the style of LQAICGI"," "]},{"id":11,"type":"SaveImage","pos":[1617.9071044921875,2363.260498046875],"size":[270,270],"flags":{},"order":6,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"images","name":"images","type":"IMAGE","link":12},{"localized_name":"filename_prefix","name":"filename_prefix","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"filename_prefix"},"link":null}],"outputs":[],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.56"},"widgets_values":["LQAICGI"]},{"id":1,"type":"PrimitiveString","pos":[-952.1503295898438,2390.52783203125],"size":[270,58],"flags":{},"order":1,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"value","name":"value","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"value"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"STRING","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[1]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.56","Node name for S&R":"PrimitiveString"},"widgets_values":["A chemical plant consisting of three buildings: one old-style brick building with arched windows, towers and a chimney.
